# rss-feed-reader
this script can pull multiple rss feeds and show them in one feed. 


# Demo
I have this running here if you want to take a look at it live. https://weboasis.digital/news/

# Adding feeds
Scroll down to the code where it says Define the RSS feeds to be read and right under that you will see the two current feeds. 
just do 
{url: "https://thewebsitethatyouwillbepullingitsfeedfrom.com/feed", title: "thefeed you are pulling"}

right under the last feed to add a new one.
